# Overly Broad CSS Selector Causing Unintended Style Application

This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue where an overly broad selector unintentionally applies styles to elements where they are not needed.  The example shows the `.error` class applied to multiple elements, some where a red color is appropriate, but others where it is not.

The solution demonstrates using more specific selectors to target only the intended elements, fixing the styling issue.
